\begin{abstract}

Ontologies as formal specification of domain knowledge have been well used for annotating real-life data especially in the biomedical domain. As researchers analyze huge amounts of data that are annotated by large biomedical ontologies, one of the major challenges for data mining is to leverage both ontologies and data together in a systematic and scalable way. In this paper, we address two interesting and related problems for mining biomedical ontologies and data: i) how to discover \emph{semantic associations} with the help of formal ontologies; ii) how to identify potential errors in the ontologies with the help of data. By representing both ontologies and data in \textit{RDF hypergraphs} and subsequently transforming the hypergraphs to corresponding bipartite or tripartite forms for the purpose of designing pertinent mining algorithms,  we provide a generalized data mining method that scales beyond what existing ontology-based approaches can provide. We use random walk with restart to efficiently calculate the similarity between concepts so as to determine their associations from very large size of data and ontologies. We show the proposed method is indeed capable of capturing semantic (indirect) associations while seamlessly incorporate domain knowledge defined in ontologies through experiments performed with real life data and ontologies. We also show that our data mining methods can discover the errors in biomedical ontologies injected by human operations. This research also contributes to an emerging research direction of \emph{semantic data mining}, in which formal semantics that exist in data and knowledge can be represented and incorporated into the data mining process in a seamless way.


%In this paper, we address an interesting data mining problem of finding semantically associated itemsets (i.e., items connected via indirect links) on ontology-annotated datasets. Semantically rich datasets, such as those annotated by formal ontologies and represented in RDF or OWL, can be viewed as datasets embedded with domain knowledge. This new standard of representation provides a unique opportunity to mine the data and domain knowledge simultaneously. In this paper, we develop a way to represent both data and ontology in a unified graph representation, and we propose to use random walk with restart to efficiently calculate the similarity between items so as to determine their associations from very large size of data and ontologies.
%We show the proposed method is indeed capable of capturing semantically associated itemsets while seamlessly incorporate domain knowledge defined in ontologies through experiments performed with real life data and ontologies. The semantically associated itemsets discovered in our experiment is promising to provide valuable insights on interrelationship between medical concepts and other domain specific ones.
