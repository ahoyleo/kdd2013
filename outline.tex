Motivation: increasing amount of annotated data; previous research focused on using ontologies to help data mining in an ad hoc way; or vice versa. This is the first framework to use ontologies and data seamless and proved that ontologies can improve mining semantic association, while on the other hand, data can help identify errors inconsistencies in ontologies.

Methodology: rdf hypergraph 

Case studies:

1) shopping cart/NCBO: using ontologies to help improve semantic association mining. comparing with the ICDM work

2) noised NCBO ontologies: using data mining to help discover inconsistencies and errors in ontologies.
