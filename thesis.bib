  abstract={The assessment of knowledge derived from databases depends on many factors. Decision makers often need to convince others about the correctness and effectiveness of knowledge induced from data.The current data mining techniques do not contribute much to this process of persuasion.Part of this limitation can be removed by integrating knowledge from experts in the field, encoded in some accessible way, with knowledge derived form patterns stored in the database.In this paper we will in particular discuss methods for implementing monotonicity constraints in economic decision problems.This prior knowledge is combined with data mining algorithms based on decision trees and neural networks.The method is illustrated in a hedonic price model.},

    abstract = {{A semantic network or net is a graphic notation for representing knowledge in patterns of interconnected nodes and arcs. Computer implementations of semantic networks were first developed for artificial intelligence and machine translation, but earlier versions have long been used in philosophy, psychology, and linguistics. What is common to all semantic networks is a declarative graphic representation that can be used either to represent knowledge or to support automated systems for reasoning about knowledge. Some versions are highly informal, but other versions are formally defined systems of logic. Following are six of the most common kinds of semantic networks, each of which is discussed in detail in one section of this article. 1. Definitional networks emphasize the subtype or is-a relation between a concept type and a newly defined subtype. The resulting network, also called a generalization or subsumption hierarchy, supports the rule of inheritance for copying properties defined for a supertype to all of its subtypes. Since definitions are true by definition, the information in these networks is often assumed to be necessarily true.}},
